The biological clock ticks for both men as well as women
A man's fertility appears to decline after the age of 40, in much the same way that a woman's ability to conceive fades after 35, say French researchers. 
Dr Elise de La Rochebrochard and team, from the French national health institute INSERM, report their findings in the May issue of the journal Fertility and Sterility.
Their study, of nearly 2,000 couples undergoing fertility treatment, found that pregnancy attempts were 70% more likely to fail when the man was age 40 or older than if he were younger than 30, regardless of his wife's age. 
"As an increasing number of couples choose to postpone child-bearing, they should be informed that paternal age over 40 years is an important risk factor for failure to conceive," say de La Rochebrochard and team.
Because all the women in the study were completely sterile and undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the age of the fathers was key. 
And while past studies have suggested that older men are less likely to father children, the extent to which this was related to biological changes or to decreased sexual activity has been unclear. 
"Our results provide, for the first time, strong evidence for a paternal age effect on failure to conceive that is linked only to biological male ageing," the researchers say. 
According to the researchers, the lower IVF success rate among relatively older men may be due to poorer-quality sperm. 
It has long been known that women are less likely to conceive after the age of 35 than before, say the researchers
But the current findings, they say, suggest that for men, the age of 40 is similarly important.
"In reproduction," the researchers conclude, "age must no longer be considered as the concern of the woman, but as that of the couple."
