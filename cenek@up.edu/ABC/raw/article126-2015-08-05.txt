A scientist who says he has achieved 'cold fusion' using sound waves to make bubbles is being investigated by his current university after complaints from colleagues.
Nuclear engineer Professor Rusi Taleyarkhan's work has been controversial since he published a study in 2002 claiming to have achieved the Holy Grail of energy production, nuclear fusion at room temperature. 
If scientists can duplicate the results and harness the technology, which is based on the process that powers the Sun, tabletop fusion has the potential to provide an almost limitless source of cheap energy. 
Many labs are working frantically to try to do so, but their efforts are difficult to substantiate and especially susceptible to being labelled as fraud. 
Taleyarkhan, whose study was published while he was at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, now works at Purdue University in Indiana and has also been trying to replicate his earlier findings. 
He says he did this in 2004. 
Purdue provost Sally Mason says her office is checking complaints from some of Taleyarkhan's co-workers. 
"Purdue last week initiated a review of this research and these allegations," Mason says. 
"The research claims involved are very significant and the concerns expressed are extremely serious. Purdue will explore all aspects of the situation thoroughly and announce the results at the appropriate time," she adds. 
"To ensure objectivity, the review is being conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research, which is separate from the College of Engineering." 
Something amiss?
The journal Nature reports today it has interviewed several of Taleyarkhan's colleagues who suspect something is amiss. 
"Faculty members Lefteri Tsoukalas and Tatjana Jevremovic, along with several others who do not wish to be named, say that since Taleyarkhan began working at Purdue, he has removed the equipment with which they were trying to replicate his work, claimed as 'positive' experimental runs for which they never saw the raw data, and opposed the publication of their own negative results," according to Nature. 
"In addition, Brian Naranjo at the University of California, Los Angeles, is submitting to Physical Review Letters an analysis of Taleyarkhan's recently published data that strongly suggests he has detected not fusion, but a standard lab source of radioactivity." 
Naranjo's lab reported in April 2005 that it had achieved cold fusion by heating a lithium crystal soaked in deuterium gas. 
Engineers and physicists have been cautious about Taleyarkhan's technique but say in theory it could work. 
In the original report
In his original report, published in the journal Science in 2002, Talayarkhan and colleagues say they created nuclear fusion in a beaker of chemically altered acetone by bombarding it with neutrons and then sound waves to make bubbles. 
When the bubbles burst, the researchers say they detected fusion energy. 
The 2004 experiment used uranyl nitrate, a salt of natural uranium. 
Experts have been especially sceptical about cold fusion claims since Britons Professor Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons of the University of Southampton held a news conference in 1989 to claim they had achieved it. 
Fleischmann and Pons were ridiculed when no-one could duplicate their efforts.
