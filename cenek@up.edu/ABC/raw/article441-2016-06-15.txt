Drizzle one day, flash floods the next
It's raining methane on Saturn's giant moon Titan, scientists say.
It ranges from a persistent drizzle that keeps the surface of Saturn's largest moon damp to fierce storms that could produce huge droplets.
"We have found the first evidence of drizzly rain on a remote planet, in this case Titan, which consists of liquid methane and a little bit of nitrogen," says Dr Tetsuya Tokano of Germany's University of Cologne.
Tokano and his colleagues publish their findings today in the journal Nature.
The researchers used data from the NASA/European Space Agency Cassini-Huygens mission to measure the atmospheric chemical composition, temperature and pressure on Titan. 
The Cassini craft was launched in 1997 and reached Saturn in 2004 after cruising past Venus and Jupiter. 
Information from the probe showed Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury, is cold and windy with a dense atmosphere of methane and nitrogen.
According to the team's findings, much of the surface of Titan could experience a drizzle for the next few years. 
Fierce storms too
In a separate report in the journal researchers from Spain modelled Titan's atmosphere.
They predicted clouds over the south pole would produce fierce storms that would pound the surface and could help explain the formation of its river valleys. 
Dr Ricardo Hueso and Dr Agustin Sanchez-Lavega of the University of Pais Vasco in Bilbao say under the right conditions the storms could produce methane raindrops up to 5 millimetres across that would pound the surface similar to flash floods seen on Earth.
Tokano says although the Spanish researchers reached a different conclusion he believes both types of rainfall could occur on Titan depending on the conditions.
"We do not rule out the presence of such heavy rainstorms because such clouds have been observed near the south pole," he adds.
