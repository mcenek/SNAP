DNA evidence has questioned the quality of &#214;tzi's sperm, which may have affected his standing in Stone Age society
A Stone Age man found frozen in the Alps some 5300 years after he was murdered under mysterious circumstances may have been a childless social outcast, a new study shows. 
Italian anthropologist Dr Franco Rollo, from the University of Camerino, studied fragments of the DNA belonging to &#214;tzi, as the mummy has become known.
Rollo and his colleagues describe in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology how he found two typical mutations common among men with reduced sperm mobility.
A high percentage of men with such a condition are sterile, according to the museum that stores &#214;tzi the iceman.
"Insofar as the 'iceman' was found to possess both mutations, the possibility that he was unable to father offspring cannot be eliminated," says the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in the Alpine town of Bolzano.
"This not improbable hypothesis raises new questions concerning his social rank within his society," it adds, arguing that the new evidence supports a theory that views the man as a social outcast. 
Hikers discovered &#214;tzi in the mountains between Italy and Austria in 1991. 
In 2001, scientists found an arrowhead in the iceman's shoulder blade, and tests revealed blood from four different people on his clothes and a cut in his hand, possibly from a fight. 
Medicine in the man's pockets and sophisticated weapons seemed to indicate that he was a shaman or a chieftain.
One theory says &#214;tzi was the victim of a power struggle in his own tribe. A rival theory proposes the opposite, that he was a reject. 
Rollo and his colleagues were also able to assign the mummy's DNA to one of the basic groups of human DNA historically occurring in Europe. 
His basic DNA resembles that of the Ladines, an ethnic group still living in the region today, and that of residents of the &#214;tztal valley where he was found, the museum says.
