Latest image of the first light in the universe
Fresh evidence of the first objects to emerge after the Big Bang has left scientists debating what these could be.
Researchers say the cosmic glow could be the first stars or quasars, but are not sure which.
Dr Alexander Kashlinsky and colleagues at the  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center will report their findings in the 1 January issue of The Astrophysical Journal.
Using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the researchers analysed infrared radiation from deep space.
They first removed the bright signal of recent galaxies in the foreground to detect the the ancient background glow.
The researchers saw clumps in this infrared background radiation they believe comes from the first objects to emerge from the Big Bang.
"Observing the cosmic infrared background is like watching distant fireworks from within a brightly lit city," says Kashlinsky. 
"It's as if we have turned off the city lights one by one to see the bursts more clearly."
Building on their study published in the journal Nature last year, the researchers say they could be picking up light from the earliest stars, stretched to infrared wavelengths by the expansion of the universe.
Alternatively, they say the distant glow could be from quasars - large black holes that consume enormous amounts of gas and debris and re-emit the materials in powerful burst of energy.
Less certain the glow comes from stars
Last year the researchers were reportedly certain the signals from deep space were from the earliest stars.
Kashlinksy says this was because his team failed to explain that current equipment does not allow the researchers to pinpoint individual sources of the radiation.
"We did not make this point sufficiently clear in the Nature paper in 2005 and, hence, added a caveat on this in the new papers," says Kashlinksy.
"While we can't resolve each spark in the fireworks, we can see the large scale structures and their glow."
