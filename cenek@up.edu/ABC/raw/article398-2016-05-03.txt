The plan is to use magnets to attract iron oxide nanoparticles attached to genes
Magnets may one day drag genes around the body in a novel form of gene therapy, says a Swiss scientist.
The magnets would be attracted to iron oxide nanoparticles attached to the genes, a concept that has been tested in sheep.
But many safety tests would be needed before this technology could be used in humans, says Professor Heinrich Hofmann of the
Ecole Polytechnique F�d�rale de Lausanne in Switzerland.
Hofmann reported his findings at the International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in Brisbane last week.
Gene therapy has been beset with problems including the lack of a safe and effective vector to transport therapeutic genes into cells.
Hofmann says his iron oxide nanoparticles are safer than commonly used viral vectors, which can mutate and influence the DNA of cells.
"The iron oxide particle is less dangerous than a virus," he says.
He also says the nanoparticles can be controlled more precisely than a virus because they can be moved into place with a magnet.
In a recent experiment, Hofmann injected iron nanoparticles attached to a green fluorescent protein gene into the joint of sheep and used a magnet to move the gene into place.
The sheep cells produced green fluorescent protein that glowed green under light, proving the success of the experiment, Hoffman says.
The research has been published in the Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.
Activating stem cells
In another application, Hofmann is using magnets and iron oxide nanoparticles to activate the growth of bone stem cells.
In vitro experiments have shown that iron oxide nanoparticles injected into stem cells can be vibrated with magnets to boost cell growth.
"We know from a fracture that if you mechanically stimulate the bone then the growth is enhanced," he says. "The healing rate is improved. And we are now doing this on a cellular level."
This work is being patented and is yet to be published.
Safety issues
Iron oxide nanoparticles are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in magnetic resonance imaging, says Hoffman. 
But these particles have different coatings not designed to penetrate cells, and are cleared via the blood into the liver.
The iron oxide nanoparticles Hofmann uses have a coating of polymers and specific chemical groups designed to help them penetrate cells. 
Because of this, and because the safety of nanoparticles in general is still being investigated, Hofmann says his laboratory is careful to contain the nanoparticles to prevent them from escaping.
He says after doing their job, the nanoparticles would be cleared through the lymphatic system into the kidney where they would gradually be cleared from the body.
But, he says, there is a risk the nanoparticles could create local inflammation or toxic shock.
Another danger is they could clump together and clog up the kidney, says Hoffman, and many more safety tests are required.
Hofmann's research is publicly funded.
