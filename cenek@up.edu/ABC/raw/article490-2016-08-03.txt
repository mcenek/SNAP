Our Moon may qualify for the title of 'planet' if it continues to move away from the Earth
The proposed new definition of a planet has got scientists talking, some saying it means even our Moon could one day be labelled a planet.
Astronomer Dr Charles Lineweaver of the  Australian National University says he is generally in favour of the draft International Astronomical Union (IAU) definition, but it has some potential problems.
"According to the new definition of planets, our Moon ... will become a planet in the future," says Lineweaver.
Under the draft definition, which astronomers will vote on next week in Prague, a planet must orbit a star, while not being itself a star, and it must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape.
Under this definition, Charon would no longer be a satellite of Pluto. Rather both would qualify as planets, of the pluton type.
Central to this double-planet system is a common centre of gravity, or barycentre, that exists in free space above the surface of Pluto.
By contrast, our Moon would remain a satellite under the new definition because the barycentre of the system is located below the Earth's surface.
But Lineweaver says as the Moon is moving further away from the Earth, this means the barycentre will one day be above Earth's surface.
"The Moon will have to be about 40% further away than it is now for it to become a planet," he says.
"Based on an extrapolation of the current recession of the Moon, this will happen in about 5 billion plus or minus 1 billion years."
