==== INSTALLING SNAP ON A NEW MACHINE ====
==========================================

This file is a guide on setting up the SNAP on a new server.

Tested Compatibility:
Linux Ubuntu 18.04, 16.10
Mac OsX
==========================================
1. System prerequisites:
Simple setup:
  Install WAMP,MAMP, or LAMP.
  Install phpMyAdmin in the www/ directory
  Install SNAP in the www/ director
  Create a SNAP folder on your Web server
      linux: sudo mkdir /var/www/html/SNAP
      MAC: htdocs/SNAP
  Download CodeIgnighter from https://codeigniter.com/ and put unpacked files into your SNAP folder

==========================================
2. SNAP installation and configuration

a. Clone the repository. If you are a new developer contributing to SNAP, you
should fork the repository from mcenek/SNAP:
git clone https://github.com/mcenek/SNAP.git
Notes:
 - You may want to rename the application folder in the repository before your SNAP repo installation, or alternatively, do not migrate the application folder from the
Code Igniter download.
 - You should NOT replace the existing .gitignore in the SNAP repo with the one from CI.
 - It is not necessary to migrate the user_guide directory, but it also won't hurt anything, and may contain some useful resources.

b. Place the files from cloned repo's SNAP to your local SNAP folder that currently has the codeigniter base
Make sure you merge the folders and overwrite the codeigniter files with the SNAP's repo files

c. In your database.php file, update the username and password fields to whatever
database account you want the site to use. If you haven't set up the mysql db
yet, do so now: There are lots of tutorials online for setting up a mysql db
locally. You'll also need an apache server set up, if you're on a linux machine,
follow a guide on setting up a LAMP Server, if you're on a mac, just use MAMP, and if you're on windows use WAMP.

In your web browser navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin lo g in with your credentials
  go to ->import the SNAP's sql database and select the sql_db.sql file that came with the project's repo (file is in the SNAP folder) 
  select nlp_db database then add a user:
     ->privilages -> new user -> add new user 
       as an example: 
        username:nlpuser password:nlppassword
        privileged: 'global privileges' "check all" -- a very generous and dangerous option
                    'data' select all options for data manipulation -- better/safer option

At this point you must change some machine specific config files.
Go to application/config/ and you should see two _TEMPLATE files, config and database.

d. configure SNAP's database with your installation
delete SNAP/application/config/database.php
rename SNAP/application/config/database_TEMPLATE.php -> SNAP/application/config/database.php
replace Line 79 and 80 with "nlpuser" and "nlppassword" that you just created

e. configure SNAP's site with your configuration
delete SNAP/application/config/config.php
rename SNAP/application/config/config_TEMPLATE.php -> SNAP/application/config/config.php
Edit lines 26, 29, 32 with the spefici location of the SNAP folder on your system 
On Linux, this is most likely /var/www/html/SNAP
On Mac, this is most likely htdocs/SNAP
unless the SNAP application files and user uploaded documents are in different locations, the line entries 29 and 32 are the same path          

In your new config.php file, change the value for line:
    $config['base_url'] = "YOUR_BASE_URL";
to whatever your base url is. For running locally, this should just be:
    $config['base_url'] = "http://localhost/SNAP";
with SNAP replaced by whatever the path to the git repo is from your server root.

==========================================
3. Additional Package installation.

The first step of text processing requires NLTK toolkit that uses prebuilt models and dictionaries.
Install the NLTK from command line:



                            
Unless I've forgotten something crucial (likely), as long as you have your
server and database running, you should be set up. Go to your base url to test.
