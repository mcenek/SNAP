Could the hobbit really be one of us after all? 
Scientists who argue the hobbit is really just a modern human with a small brain have published evidence for the first time in a major scientific journal.
Today's issue of the journal Science carries a paper led by primate evolution expert, Dr Bob Martin of The Field Museum in Chicago, which says Homo floresiensis is likely to have been a modern human who suffered from microcephaly, a condition that causes a small brain.
This reignites the debate about whether the remains of the small hominid from the Indonesian island of Flores is really H. sapiens or a dwarf version of H. erectus that evolved after becoming isolated on the island, as was originally suggested.
Martin's team says that based on standard models of dwarfing, the hobbit's brain size is way too small to be that of a dwarf.
It also argues the tools found alongside the hobbit are far too advanced to have been made by anyone but H. sapiens.
"If you look at the history of stone tools around the world Homo erectus never made tools like that," says Martin.
"I've been in this business for 30 years and I really smell a rat in this," he says. "I don't think the standard story can be right and people are eventually going to see this."
His team also rejects findings of a study published last year that found the brain of H. floresiensis was unlike that of a microcephalic human.
Martin says the study, led by brain evolution expert Professor Dean Falk of Florida State University, compared the hobbit with only one microcephalic, which he now says is a child, when the researchers should have been comparing it with a microcephalic adult.
Martin's team describes the brains of two adult microcephalic specimens, a male from India and a female from Lesotho, it says are similar to the hobbit's.
