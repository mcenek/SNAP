Online searches can help doctors keep up to date with an increasing pool of medical research
It's not just patients who are frantically plugging their symptoms into Google to see what disease they might have. Australian researchers say doctors are doing it too.
Dr Hangwi Tang and Dr Jennifer Ng of the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane report their findings today online in the British Medical Journal.
Tang says the study was driven by personal curiosity after noticing how patients and doctors alike were using Google to diagnose difficult cases.
In one example he had a patient whose father used the search engine to correctly diagnose that his son had the rare circulatory condition Paget-von Schrï¿½tter syndrome.
Tang and Ng selected 26 difficult cases presented in the New England Journal of Medicine, including Cushing's syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, encephalitis and cirrhosis.
They then plugged the symptoms of each case into the search engine to come up with a diagnosis.
When these diagnoses were compared with the correct published diagnoses, the researchers found that Google got it right 58% of the time.
They say an online search is likely to be more effective at helping to diagnose conditions with unique symptoms that can be used as search terms.
Tang says part of the challenge in using Google is to be able to efficiently sift through the many pages of links that you get from an online search.
And he thinks that doctors are better placed than patients at doing this because they are better at selecting relevant links.
"I don't think Google can replace doctors, in other words," says Tang.
Millions of facts
Doctors have been estimated to carry two million facts in their heads to help them to diagnose disease, the researchers say.
But search engines allow them to get quick access to an ever increasing medical knowledge base that might be impossible to hold in their head.
Google in particular gives access to more than three billion articles, they say, with Google Scholar restricting searches to peer reviewed articles.
Tang says while there are a number of other search engines that clinicians can use, they often prefer Google because it is so easy to use and freely available.
Other studies
Professor Johanna Westbrook of the Centre for Health Informatics in Sydney says the findings are consistent with her own.
Her team looked at how specialised search engines could help clinicians to both diagnose and treat patients, using the best available evidence.
The study found clinicians were 21% more likely to give the correct answers when they used online search engines.
Interestingly though, a few clinicians got the wrong answers using the search engines, although they got the right answers without them.
Westbrook says this underscores the importance of learning how to interpret complex evidence.
Another interesting finding was that clinical nurse consultants using the search engines were just as accurate as doctors.
Westbrook says this suggests search engines might help such nurses to diagnose and treat patients in rural areas where there are fewer doctors.
"[An online search engine is] available 24 hours a day," she says. "Whereas you can't get a clinician 24 hours a day. You can't get to a hospital library 24 hours a day."
Westbrook says that while Google might be good for helping find information about diseases with unique symptoms, more sophisticated search engines would be required for more complex diseases.
