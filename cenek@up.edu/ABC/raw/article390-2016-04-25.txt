A German scientist has used nanotechnology to create what he believes is the world's smallest soccer pitch.
Dr Stefan Trellenkamp, from the University of Kaiserslautern, made the pitch by using an electron beam to engrave lines onto a tiny piece of acrylic glass.
The pitch measures 380 by 500 nanometres and can only be seen through an electron microscope.
"I am really, really proud," the nanotechnology researcher says.
"The only problem is that I really don't know what to do with it. I can't put it on show as no one can see it," he says. "I guess it'll just stay in my drawer for the time being." 
Trellenkamp says it took him a whole day to etch the pitch, which is so small that 20,000 of them could fit onto the tip of a human hair.
