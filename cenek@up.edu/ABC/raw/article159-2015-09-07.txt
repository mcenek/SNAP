The research behind the 2006 Abel Prize for maths explains how violin strings vibrate
The world's most prestigious maths prize has been awarded to a Swedish researcher for his work on wave patterns.
Professor Lennart Carleson of the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden was awarded the Abel Prize for maths for his work on the Fourier series.
This says that everything from the vibration of violin strings to the spread of heat through a metal bar can be viewed as sums of simple wave patterns, oscillating sine and cosine waves.
This led to the branch of maths known as harmonic analysis.
He also solved the so-called corona problem, which looks at structures that show up around a disc when the disc itself is hidden.
An example might be the corona of the Sun seen during an eclipse, when it's hidden by the Moon.
The prize, which is awarded by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, is often described as the 'Nobel' prize for maths.
The prize rules say it should aim to spur interest in mathematics among children and young people. So far, all winners of the prize have been in their 70s.
