Fears that retreating permafrost is accelerating climate change have been strengthened by a new study that says emissions of the greenhouse gas methane are soaring in northern Siberia.
In a complex cycle, permafrost melts at the edges of lakes that previously were iced over year-round, according to the research led by Dr Katey Walter of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.
Organic material, the remains of rotted plants and long-dead animals, then subsides into the lake from the soil, slides to the lake bottom and decomposes to form methane.
Eventually, during a thaw, this methane bubbles to the surface and is released into the atmosphere. 
In the first major study into the bubbling phenomenon, or ebullition, Walter's team believes that current estimates of methane released from wetlands between latitudes 65 and 70&deg; north should be upgraded by 10-63%.
"Ebullition from Siberian thaw lakes is a large and increasing source of atmospheric [methane] as Siberian thaw lakes continue to expand," warns the study, published today in the journal Nature.
Between 1974 and 2000, a period that matches figures for local warming, the spread of thaw lakes caused methane emissions in Siberia to rise by 58%, it says.
The greenhouse gas methane comes from natural sources such as agriculture, decomposing vegetation and marshland. 
One worry is what scientists called a "positive feedback" from billions of tonnes of stored methane that is locked in the ground and under frozen lakes in  Canada and Siberia. 
This scenario, in essence, is a vicious circle, scientists say: global warming warms up the permafrost, which releases the trapped methane and this in turn adds to the greenhouse effect. 
Volume for volume, methane is 21 times more effective at trapping solar heat respectively than carbon dioxide.
By itself, methane accounts for a fifth of the man-made greenhouse effect of the past 200 years, scientists say.
