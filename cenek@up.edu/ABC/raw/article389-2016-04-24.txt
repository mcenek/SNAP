Vascular disease may be associated with particular types of migraine
Adults who suffer from bouts of migraine without aura have slightly narrower retinal blood vessels than adults without migraine, Australian research shows.
The finding supports the hypothesis that microvascular disease may be associated with certain types of migraine, investigators note.
They publish their report in the journal Headache, a journal of the American Headache Society.
Dr Gerald Liew from the University of Sydney and colleagues took photographs of people's retinas as part of the Blue Mountains Eye Study.
The researchers measured the diameters of blood vessels in 2335 people over the age of 54 who took part in the population-based cohort study.
People with a history of migraine without aura had narrower retinal blood vessels, or arterioles, than those with a history of migraine with aura or people with no history of migraine. 
The findings held up in analyses adjusting for potentially confounding factors, the researchers say.
