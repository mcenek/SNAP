Researchers can now test the effects of airborne toxins on human lung cells grown in the lab
Researchers are using 'mini-lungs' made from cells grown in the lab to test the effects of airborne toxins after workplace contamination and chemical spills.
The work has won Dr Amanda Hayes, Shahnaz Bakand and Chris Winder of the University of New South Wales (UNSW) a Eureka Prize for research that replaces the use of animals or animal products.
Hayes says the use of human epithelial lung cells reduces the need for what are often inhumane tests on animals.
Traditionally, the toxicity of gases and vapours are tested on lab animals that are put into a chamber and subjected to lethal doses.
But Hayes says the need for such tests can be reduced by using human epithelial cells grown on a porous membrane.
She says the method is well suited to field work because all investigators need to do is place the cell-containing membrane in a small diffusion chamber and pump in air.
The 'mini-lungs' can be subjected to a range of tests including energy metabolism and viability, to see how they are responding to the toxin.
Any cell death resulting from the exposure would immediately set alarm bells ringing.
Hayes says her group, the only in Australia to use lung cells in this way, has been able to test the effects of chemicals like ammonia and formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds found in paints, solvents and pesticides.
"The research may open new possibilities for toxicity testing of industrial chemicals, environmental contaminants, respiratory drugs, workplace airborne contaminants and fire combustion products," she says.
Hayes says the cells tend to be more sensitive to toxins than a functioning lung but the in vitro effects of the toxins on the cells tally well with effects observed in animals.
The same method can be used to test airborne toxicology on skin and liver cells, she says.
